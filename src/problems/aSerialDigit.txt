In a serial digit prime number, the first digit number, and the number till the second digit …the number till the n-th digit are all a prime number. 
For example, in the number 7331, the first digit number 7 is a prime number; the number till the second digit 73 is a prime number; the number till the third digit 733 is too a prime number; the number till the last digit 7331 is also a prime number. 


When a digit of a serial digit prime number to be found is given, find all serial digit prime numbers with the given digit. 


Time Limit : 1 sec (Java : 2 sec)


[Input] 

There can be more than one test case in the input file. The first line has T, the number of test cases. 
Then the totally T test cases are provided in the following lines (T ≤ 10 )


In each test case, A digit, N (1 ≤ N ≤ 8), is given in the second line. (1 ≤ N ≤ 8)



[Output]
Output one N-digit serial digit prime number in each line in an ascending order. 
If there is not one serial digit prime number with the given digit, output 0. 
Each test case must be output separately as a empty line. (Last test case also need a empty line.)
