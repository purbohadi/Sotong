In order for a living creature to survive, it needs an appropriate size of territory of its own. 
Hence, it is natural that living organisms fight over territory. 
In the figure above places where a rabbit left its scent to mark its areas were shown with red dots, 
and the inside of a polygon drawn with a black line which includes all dots is called a territory. 
If there is an intruder, in many cases a fierce fight takes places. 


When multiple dots with which a rabbit marked its areas are given, what is the area of the rabbit’s territory that includes all dots?


Time limit : 1 sec (Java : 2 sec)


[Input]
There can be more than one test case in the input file. The first line has T, the number of test cases. 
Then the totally T test cases are provided in the following lines (T ≤ 10 )


In each test case, 
In the first line, the number of dots N (3 ≤ N ≤ 100) is given. 
From the second line, two integers x and y (-10000 ≤ x, y ≤ 10000) are given, separated by blanks in N lines. 
X and y are coordinates of i-th dot, and the coordinates of each dot are different from each another. 


[Output]
Output the area of the rabbit’s territory after rounding to hundredths place in the first line.
