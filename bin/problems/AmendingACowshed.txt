A typhoon swept through the night, leaving roofs and doors of a cowshed missing.
The single-row cowshed is made of sections of the same width; cows have gone in some sections while cows stay in others. 
For sections whose door is missing, as least one board should be installed so that the cows cannot run away. 
The timber merchant cuts a board to the size you want, but the number of boards is fixed. 
In addition, the price is high, so the total length of the board to be purchased should be minimized. 
When M boards are used for all sections where cows stay, find the minimum value of the total length of the board. 


Time limit : 1 sec (Java : 2 sec)


[Input]
There can be more than one test case in the input file. The first line has T, the number of test cases. 
Then the totally T test cases are provided in the following lines (T ≤ 10 )

In each test case, 
In the first line, three integers M, N and C are given (1 ≤ M ≤ 50, 1 ≤ C ≤ N ≤ 200). 
M is the number of boards that sell at the timber merchant’s; N is the total number of sections; C is the number of sections where cows stay. 
(Each section has its own given number and) numbers of sections where the cows stay are given in C lines. 


[Output]
In the each line, output the minimum value of the total length of the board when all sections with cows in them are boarded up with M boards.

[Example Explanation]


Since only 4 boards should be used, one board is used for sections of 3-8, 14-17, 21-31, and 40-43 each. 
In this case, the total length of the board is 25.
